\chapter{API}

PET's javadocs are not great, but they are getting better.
If you have not built the internal documentation you can do it using \href{http://ant.apache.org/}{ant}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashStyle]
ant javadoc
\end{lstlisting}

This should create the directory \texttt{dist/javadoc}, where you can find \texttt{index.html}.

\section{PEJ}

Look for the javadoc for the class \texttt{pet.pej.PEJBuilder}.
